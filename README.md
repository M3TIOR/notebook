# M3TIOR's Jupyter Notebook
My personal Jupyter Notebook made public for other peeps to grab at.

I just found out that Github supports compilation of
Jupyter Notebooks. So just navigate to which ever notebook *page* you think
might be interesting and take a look. Not all are guaranteed to work, but most
will. Especially ones that uses kernels as opposed to nonstandard magics,
and native Jupyter features.

This may also serve as a redundant storage location for some of my blog
posts as I do plan on using my notebook for writing certain blog posts.
If my blog is down for some reason, or you just want to look at my scraps
as well you're welcome to it all.

**Have at it!**

Much love,<br/>
M3TIOR
