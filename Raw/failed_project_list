M3TIOR's Failed Projects
========================

This is a comprehensive list of all the projects I started either without
doing the necessary research first or decided I wanted to build and then
abandoned after I did said research because it wasn't possible.

## Chromate
### Objective
I wanted to build a Chrome APP manager for linux, so I could have a gui to access them without going through chromium/chrome's dastardly UIs.

### Why was it cancled?
I started the project around mid 2019, and didn't know Google had recently released a statement about ending APP support in
Chromium/Chrome in favor of native executables and the Android APK format. I got about three hours into the project and found
an article published regarding Googles statement. Just long enough for me to solidify a good name for the project and write
the `application.json`.
